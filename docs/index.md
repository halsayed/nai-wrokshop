## About This Workshop

In this one-day workshop, you will learn the fundamentals of Generative AI (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs), explore Nutanix's AI infrastructure solution (NAI) for running AI workloads at scale, and build practical chatbot applications with open-source frameworks. You will gain hands-on experience deploying AI-driven applications on Nutanix Kubernetes Platform (NKP), automating operations, and integrating AI into low-code/no-code workflows.
