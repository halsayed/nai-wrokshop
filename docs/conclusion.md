# Conclusion & Next Steps

## Workshop Summary

Congratulations on completing the "Empowering Infrastructure Teams with GenAI" workshop! Throughout this one-day session, you've:

- Learned the fundamentals of Large Language Models and Generative AI
- Deployed LLMs on Nutanix infrastructure using NAI
- Built a functional chatbot with document understanding capabilities
- Integrated AI tools into your development workflow
- Created automated processes using low-code/no-code tools

## Key Takeaways

1. **Infrastructure Matters for AI**: Properly configured infrastructure is critical for running AI workloads efficiently and at scale.

2. **GenAI Has Practical Applications for Infrastructure Teams**: From code assistance to documentation generation to automated workflows, GenAI can significantly enhance infrastructure operations.

3. **Kubernetes is the Foundation**: Containerization and Kubernetes provide the flexibility and scalability needed for AI workloads.

4. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Unlocks Enterprise Value**: Connecting LLMs to your organization's data is where the real business value lies.

5. **Prompt Engineering is a Critical Skill**: The ability to effectively instruct AI systems is becoming as important as traditional coding.
